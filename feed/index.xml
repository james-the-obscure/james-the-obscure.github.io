										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Notes on Western elites&#8217; attempt to discard an ancient cultural trait</em><span id="more-548"></span></p>
<p>If you have spent significant time outside the Western world, you may have noticed that non-Western peoples retain many of the traditional cultural traits that Westerners have abandoned. One of these traits is ethnonationalism: the basing of the nation upon a supermajority core ethnicity or cluster of related ethnicities.</p>
<p>The retention of ethnonationalism by non-Western countries is fortunate for Western tourists who value “experiencing other cultures.” If all countries were made of the same gray, global blend of ethnicities, there would be—almost by definition—little to differentiate one from another. Westerners also tacitly idealize ethnonationalism whenever they sympathize with the plight of some Amazonian rainforest tribe threatened by modern ranchers, or lament what was done to Native Americans, or take the side of ethnic minorities anywhere. The principle underlying these sentiments is that a grouping of people of at least broadly shared lineage—a family at the smallest scale, a clan or tribe at medium scale, an ethnicity or <em>nation</em> at the largest scale—has an inherent identity and worth, so that its preservation, and its ability to exercise a meaningful degree of autonomy, are desirable, and its deliberate dissolution is something like murder.</p>
<p>It is surely one of the most remarkable developments of modern human history that in the near-century since World War II—in schools, in media, in legal and political discourse—the West’s educated elites have done their best to discourage their peoples from applying this principle to themselves. “Discourage” is putting it mildly: Mainstream public opinion in the West now typically frames Western ethnonationalism as a harmful outdated attitude that lives on only in the hearts of a few embittered racists (“white nationalists”). Even “right wing” thought leaders now commonly reject the old ethnonation model and accept the new model of a heavily polyethnic, “contractual” nation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">In practice the term [“self-government”] seems most commonly to refer to “government by persons of the same race, culture, language, or social class or as oneself.” Since I am not, in fact, a bigot, it’s quite unclear why this should matter to me. (Curtis Yarvin, “Democracy as an Adaptive Fiction,” 2007.)</p>
<p><strong>The Whys</strong></p>
<p>What prompted the West’s elites to want to discard this ancient, basic element of culture?</p>
<p>We can’t experiment on societies to resolve such questions conclusively, but there are several broad influences that—at least to me—seem obvious:</p>
<ul>
<li>The principal religion of the West, Christianity, essentially was conceived as a fork or update of Judaism that, among other innovations, would not be limited to ethnic Jews but would instead hold in its “catholic” embrace the many distinct peoples of the world—particularly those of the Roman Empire. In that sense, Christianity has always been at least mildly pro-globalist and anti-ethnonationalist. In modern times, that “we’re all God’s children” sentiment has remained as an influence on Western peoples even as the rest of Christian theology and ethics has mostly been eroded away.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a></li>
<li>In the World War II era, the development of malignant forms of ethnonationalism in Germany, Italy, Japan and other Axis countries served broadly to discredit this traditional model of nationhood and encourage a more globalist mindset.</li>
<li>That turbulent wartime era also brought large refugee flows, which reduced the dominance of core ethnicities in many Western countries, directly and by adding foreign-born intellectuals—many of them leftists who detested ethnonationalism—to the ranks of Western elites.</li>
<li>The United States, throughout its history and <a href="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/democracy-in-america-the-electorate-packing-problem/">largely for reasons of political expediency</a>, has admitted to its citizenry a wider and wider range of ethnicities, including even a large West African-derived population for the past 150+ years. This demographic reality—a <em>fait accompli</em>—is plainly incompatible with ethnonationalism, even though the U.S.’s founders (e.g., the anti-German Franklin, the anti-French, anti-Irish Hamilton) would be considered intensely and narrowly ethnonationalist by today’s standards. Americans didn’t really have to confront this incompatibility until their extensive racial segregation system was disbanded in the 1960s. When that happened, they began embracing the post-ethnonationalist, contractual-nation ideal in earnest, and the enormous influence of the U.S. ensured the spread of that new ideal to other Western countries.</li>
<li>Over the past several decades, the unprecedented increase in the presence (and therefore influence/power) of women in public life in the West essentially has given women an opportunity to <a href="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/the-demise-of-guythink/">review and remodel</a> Western civilization in accordance with their own <a href="https://thoughtsofstone.github.io/the-great-feminization/">distinct set of preferences</a>. Women, on average compared to men, are more easily moved to compassion by stories of desperate refugees, etc. They also seem more vulnerable to feelings of guilt and shame over the West’s financial and technological supremacy and the related inequalities they observe between European-heritage whites and other ethnicities in daily life. All this has made them more susceptible to and supportive of the pro-polyethnic—or even anti-white—mindset.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>So what?</strong></p>
<p>Does it matter that the ancient cultural trait of ethnonationalism has been rejected or at least suppressed in Western countries? Can’t we live without that potentially malignant mindset?</p>
<p>Perhaps the best way to answer, at least initially, is with a simple invitation to look around. What do you see? Are things going well? Do Western polyethnic societies seem healthy?</p>

<p>Surely it’s fair to say that, to most Westerners, the most prominent and meaningful social trends here in early 2025 are profoundly negative ones—often plainly featuring the decay of traditional Western social structures and cultural traditions.</p>
<p>Presumably the globalists, the anti-ethnonationalists, would blame such negative perceptions on racism, their go-to bogeyman, or would aver that a certain amount of social upheaval is necessary in the transition to a globalized, Benetton-advert utopia.</p>
<p>But I think that if we specify the problems of contemporary Western countries in more detail, it becomes clear that the post-ethnonationalist program, while it may have created enormous economic benefits for non-Westerners and (via cheaper labor) some Western business owners, is just unsustainable:</p>
<p>Economic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher costs of scarce/non-producible resources such as real estate.</li>
<li>Higher costs of goods and services due to higher crime, dishonesty and other difficulties associated with having non-Western customers and employees (and a lower-trust society generally).</li>
<li>Suppression of wages due to increased labor-market competition (at all levels) from immigrants.</li>
<li>Loss of economic opportunities (and efficiency) due to (politically inevitable?) policies that favor non-Western peoples over legacy populations in hiring, contracting, academic placement etc.</li>
<li>Colossal fiscal burden from welfare programs that essentially exist to buy the votes of the less industrious non-Western residents of Western countries.</li>
</ul>
<p>Political:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increasing fracturing of politics along racial/ethnic lines as one or more parties scramble to capture the votes of immigrants and/or different non-Western ethnic groups—corrupting and destabilizing electoral systems, and making consensus impossible in many areas.</li>
<li>Increased favorability of extreme political parties and policies, authoritarianism, and police-state practices—essentially the only ways to hold a polyethnic society together.</li>
</ul>
<p>Psychological:</p>
<ul>
<li>Greater fear, uncertainty, and discontent due to the loss of the sense of community and steep declines in social trust.</li>
<li>Depression, apathy and despair from the sense that “my country doesn’t belong to me anymore,” “the leaders/elites of my country have sold my patrimony to foreigners,” etc.</li>
<li>Loss of national identity, which may lead legacy citizens to seek alternate sources of identity, e.g., Israel—and of course many immigrants will alleviate their own sense of disconnectedness by flocking together with members of their own ethnicity or by joining social/religious movements that are mostly based on shared ethnicity (e.g., militant Islam).</li>
</ul>
<p>Behavioral:</p>
<ul>
<li>More selfish and less communitarian behavior.</li>
<li>Greatly reduced collective ability to solve problems and endure hardships.</li>
<li>Greatly reduced birthrates, family formation and other pro-social behaviors.</li>
<li>Reduced “provide for the future” behavior.</li>
<li>Violent lashing-out by the least stable members of society.</li>
</ul>
<p>As real and as dangerous as these problems are, it feels odd to have to list them like this. I am old enough to remember a time when we all just implicitly <em>knew</em> that bad things would happen if our ethnonations were dissolved.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a> We also implicitly knew the positive side, which is that ethnonationalism is a basic and ancient cultural trait because it is good for us: it nourishes and empowers as other collectives do, but on the greatest possible scale. That implicit knowledge, that broadly shared (but seldom explicitly articulated) <em>feeling</em> of how things should be, is how a major, long-established cultural trait tends to manifest. The West with its imperial and catholic history, its elevation of the status of women, its cultivation of high verbal intelligence, above all its hubris, has <em>talked itself into</em> rejecting this healthy primordial feeling as the dark sin of racism.</p>
<p><strong>A higher order</strong></p>
<p>The existence of this primordial feeling in our past, and throughout the non-Western world in the present, should remind us also that a strictly reductionist, individualistic approach to cultural traits may be missing something important—&#8221;missing the forest for the trees.”</p>
<p>Suppose, for example, that some biological experimenter knocked out a certain gene in a lab animal, and found that this always led to the lethal invasion of the animal by microorganisms. It wouldn’t really be adequate to conclude simply that “the absence of this gene is bad for cells,” would it? To understand properly, we would need to have the concept of an <em>organism</em> as a meaningful collective of cells, and we would need to identify the role of the gene in some organism-level system—such as the immune system—that normally defends against infectious invaders. Moreover, once we had this concept of an organism as a thing with its own properties, we would be able to grasp intuitively that destroying the integrity of the organism would not “free” or “empower” its constituent cells but would simply doom them.</p>
<p>The analogy that compares an organism and an ethnonation is only a rough one, of course. But it should clue us in to the likelihood that the destruction of a human collective will harm its members in ways that cannot be seen from a strictly individualist point of view. From there it’s no great leap to conclude that, if only out of caution, we should treat ethnonations with more respect—indeed, in the absence of signs that they have become malignant, our first thought should be to preserve and nourish them as distinct entities with their own inherent worth.</p>
<p>Without this higher-order perspective, how could we make sense of this famous lament by the African-American writer James Baldwin?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">[Western white people] have made the modern world, in effect, even if they do not know it. The most illiterate among them is related, in a way that I am not, to Dante, Shakespeare, Michelangelo, Aeschylus, Da Vinci, Rembrandt and Racine; the cathedral at Chartres says something to them which it cannot say to me, as indeed would New York’s Empire State Building, should anyone here ever see it. Out of their hymns and dances come Beethoven and Bach. Go back a few centuries and they are in their full glory—but I am in Africa, watching the conquerors arrive.</p>
<p>Similarly, without grasping the importance of ethnically rooted identity, how could we understand the ongoing collapse of what is perhaps the world’s oldest political party, the UK Conservative Party? For well over a decade since 2010, this party was dominant over its increasingly feminized and leftist main rival, the Labour Party. Then, after a series of stumbles by its prime minister, it chose as its new leader and prime minister—in an internal process among party elites—a man of Indian heritage, Rishi Sunak. Despite the fact that Sunak was a perfectly likeable technocrat, everything collapsed. Labour, under the whiter-than-white Keir Starmer, was swept into power in a historic electoral landslide. The Conservative elites, doubling down, replaced Sunak with another nonwhite leader—Kemi Badenoch, a woman of African heritage—and despite her preaching of conservative policies on matters such as (ironically) immigration, popular support for the Conservatives continued to bleed away to a new, white-led Reform Party, which now looks set to take the Conservatives’ place.</p>
<p><strong>Is ethnonationalism recoverable?</strong></p>
<p>As obvious as this ethnic factor seems from my perspective—and as obvious as it continues to be from non-Westerners’ perspective—it has been, to date, un-acknowledgable in mainstream public discourse in the West. Even among so-called conservatives in Britain, the unpopularity of Sunak and Badenoch are said—in the major newspapers and journals of opinion—to be only skill- and policy-related. To admit that these politicians are nationally unpopular and unsuitable as UK party leaders because of their foreign ethnicity—which is to admit that most British voters retain ethnonationalist feelings—would be too painful. The elites in Britain, the “chattering classes,” have been working for decades to erase such feelings, in part by pretending that they are harbored only by low-status types: skinheads and other white-nationalist miscreants. If such feelings are still widespread despite this multi-generational brainwashing, then they are likely innate and resilient, which would imply that the post-ethnonationalist project was always doomed.</p>
<p>It would be nice if the collapse of this unsound edifice could happen in an orderly fashion, smoothly giving way to a new order—an improved version of the traditional order—in which everyone recognized ethnonations as the essential collectives around which countries and their governments form. It would be nice if self-determination for ethnonations were the first principle of our politics, and love of nation/country the first sentiment among citizens. The many large and ethnically distinct groups that are currently <a href="https://thoughtsofstone.github.io/the-other-n-word/">trapped as minorities</a> in larger societies would at last be allowed to live in worlds of their own making. And in general, at an individual level, people would benefit from the reversal of the many problems inherent in polyethnic societies—and probably would feel significantly more content just from having a clearer national identity and sense of belonging. There would continue to be ethnic mixing, of course, but at a slower pace, dominated by the traditional process of intermarriage.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a re-adoption of ethnonationalism still seems a distant prospect. It would require social surgery on a scale that no democracy would countenance except amid the most severe crisis. It would require full-throated support from Western elites who, so far, have never seemed ready to let go of the new polyethnic ideal. In the United States, for example, the permissible focus of public ire over mass immigration is not the dilution of the legacy ethnonation, but instead the much narrower issue of <em>illegal</em> immigration—a law enforcement problem. Even in the current, supposedly “far-right” US administration, both the president and vice-president are effectively <em>supporters</em> of the contractual nation model, being married to non-Western-Europeans who obtained US citizenship or residency long before their weddings. And of course, in Western Europe, to speak publicly about non-European immigrants’ disproportionate lawlessness, welfare-consumption etc. remains socially <em>verboten,</em> and in some countries is treated as a serious criminal offense punishable by a lengthy jail term.</p>
<p>Even if an ethnonationalist party were somehow able to gain power in a major Western country, and attempted to reverse that country’s polyethnic transformation, it would be opposed fiercely, especially by the multitude of individuals and institutions who have helped shape, and now benefit from, the status quo. Thus, to take an obvious example, any attempt to treat African Americans as a distinct nation deserving sovereignty would be met with shrill cries of “racism” by their current masters in the Democratic party. And any encouragement of that old-fashioned sentiment, “love of country”—<em>amor patriae</em>, meaning love of ethnonation—would be condemned by the usual suspects as a form of “hate.”</p>
<p>And let’s not forget that in political systems with elections this also about math: In many western countries, white people are well on their way to becoming minorities demographically. Moreover, half of whites—the female half—have, as noted above, an innately stronger sentimentality that makes them significantly more susceptible to anti-ethnonationalist messaging.</p>
<p>In short, then, the traditional ethnonations of the West are still a long, long way from recovering their traditional power of self-determination—that “separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them,” in the words of the American Declaration of Independence.</p>
<p>So, assuming that the contractual-nation model is unworkable, how will it ultimately fall apart in the West? The most obvious possibility, given the current situation, is that it falls apart in ways that chiefly benefit non-Westerners—Westerners having mostly psyched themselves out of having a future. In other words, the Western world, overrun with migrants, will splinter politically into states dominated by different non-Western or less-Western ethnic cores (e.g., Latinos/Mesoamericans take the American West and Southwest, MENA peoples control Western Europe), in a manner reminiscent of what happened ~1,500 years ago as the Western Roman Empire collapsed.</p>
<p>Of course, it remains <em>conceivable</em> that a leader and a movement will emerge that can make a persuasive argument for a return to ethnonationalism by the peoples of the West—and a validation of the ethnonationalism still practiced by everyone else on our planet—and I believe we and our descendants would be much better off if that were to happen. At the same time, though, I can’t help thinking that such an argument, if it were to have a reasonable chance of success, should have emerged and become popular long before now.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p><a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1">[1]</a> The somewhat related but narrower—and to me less persuasive—“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WEIRDest_People_in_the_World">WEIRD</a>” theory of Joseph Henrich holds that some specific Church practices in the Middle Ages caused Western societies to evolve, culturally and even biologically, to be more individualistic and less communitarian than other societies.</p>
<p><a href="#_ednref2" name="_edn2">[2]</a>&#8220;This bill that we will sign today is not a revolutionary bill,&#8221; claimed Lyndon Johnson when he signed the 1965 <a href="https://cis.org/Report/HartCeller-Immigration-Act-1965">Hart-Celler Act</a> liberalizing immigration law. &#8220;It does not affect the lives of millions. It will not reshape the structure of our daily lives.” He said this, obviously, because he knew that the legislation (which certainly <em>would</em> transform the country and provide the Democratic party with tens of millions of new loyal voters) conflicted with Americans’ essentially ethnonationalist feelings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>What if science is becoming toxic to human society?</em></p>
<p><span id="more-529"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the summer of 1950, Nobel-winning nuclear physicist Enrico Fermi didn’t understand the scale of the cosmos as we understand it today. But he knew that it was at least hundreds of millions of light-years across, encompassing thousands of galaxies and more than a trillion stellar systems. Unless Earth was a vanishingly rare exception, the universe should be teeming with life-forms, whose civilizations often would be far more advanced than ours.</p>
<p>And yet, as he asked his lunchmates at Los Alamos one day that summer, “where <em>is</em> everybody?” ET visitations to Earth seemed either absent entirely, or—even if some might be marked by UFO sightings—impossible to pin down as such. This discrepancy between the theoretical abundance of ETs and their observed scarcity or elusiveness became known as the Fermi Paradox.</p>
<p>Ponderers of this supposed conundrum have devised dozens if not hundreds of potential solutions. The most popular, unsurprisingly, are those that echo contemporary human concerns over climate change, nuclear war, rogue AI, etc., positing that such self-made disasters—and maybe also natural disasters like asteroid strikes and supervolcano eruptions—tend to extinguish civilizations before they can reach the star-faring stage. Elon Musk has made clear that he worries deeply about such hazards and hopes to minimize their impacts by making humans “multiplanetary,” for example by colonizing Mars.</p>
<p>The popular, accident-centered conjectures explaining the Fermi Paradox generally assume that in the absence of such cataclysms, civilizations will continue to advance scientifically and technologically, eventually venturing out to the stars. This premise also underlies the contemporary talk of a science- and tech-driven “Golden Age,” in which space travel will become routine.</p>
<p>But what if civilizations normally do <em>not</em> continue to advance beyond a stage of very limited and local space travel? What if the very process of scientific advancement in understanding the cosmos creates a toxic byproduct, analogous to pollutants from industrialization but psychological rather than chemical, such that people inevitably lose the will to explore that cosmos—and ultimately can survive only by regressing to static, relatively pre-scientific social forms?</p>
<p><strong>A Bizarre Conceit</strong></p>
<p>Although at first this might come across as unhinged doomerism, the idea that at least some important parts of science are psychologically toxic is an old and somewhat respectable one. Humans, plausibly as a condition of their civilization-building dynamism, tend to cling to a worldview in which they are very intelligent and special, there is higher “meaning” and “purpose” to their existence, and the universe is somehow about them. As philosophers have been pointing out for hundreds of years, science’s most consistent theme has been the refutation of this grandiose self-image: ”dissuading man from his former respect for himself, as if this had been nothing but a piece of bizarre conceit,” in the words of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Genealogy-Morals-Ecce-Homo/dp/0679724621">Nietzsche</a>, who certainly did consider this a bizarre conceit:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Daybreak-Thoughts-Prejudices-Cambridge-Philosophy/dp/0521599636">However</a> high mankind may have evolved &#8211; and perhaps at the end it will stand even lower than at the beginning! &#8211; it cannot pass over into a higher order, as little as the ant and the earwig can at the end of its &#8216;earthly course&#8217; rise up to kinship with God and eternal life. The becoming drags the has-been along behind it: why should an exception to this eternal spectacle be made on behalf of some little star or for any little species upon it! Away with such sentimentalities!</p>
<p>But can humanity survive without such sentimentalities, as science smashes them one by one?</p>
<p>It’s a tough question to answer, since it concerns an influence that probably works mostly beneath conscious awareness, in a psychosocial environment that is complex, to put it mildly. But one thing that seems obviously true of pretension-puncturing scientific discoveries is that they can take generations to “sink in.” Even evolutionary theory, which was already broadly accepted by scientists more than 150 years ago, does not yet seem to have fully replaced our ancient picture of ourselves as creatures made in God’s image. That delay may be attributable to powerful mechanisms of “denial,” to simple ignorance of science, to the residual competing influence of religion, and presumably also to various other socioeconomic factors that tend to counter or crowd out existential questions.</p>
<p>In any case, scientific advances that can create such “existential dissonance” tend to be relatively recent developments on the human timeline. Neuroscience’s refutation of our “free will” illusion occurred only in the last two decades, so unsurprisingly it has hardly begun to be assimilated into our self-image and our moral structures.</p>
<p>Among the sciences, cosmology is plausibly the greatest producer of existential dissonance, and in that sense its influence too has developed only recently. While it is often said that Copernicus demoted us from the center of the universe in the 1500s, his theory was not as revolutionary as it is commonly portrayed. The traditional, pre-Copernican model of the cosmos held that the Earth with its God-chosen beings lay at the center of existence, while all else revolved around it. Copernicus’s model made just one change, putting our sun at the center, which allowed a simpler, more elegant account of celestial motions even as it kept our stellar system in its place of supreme privilege. Thus, a fundamentally anthropocentric view of the universe continued to dominate cosmology—and as late as a century ago, astronomers still believed that the cosmos was very small and tidy, consisting of just our galaxy, with our solar system at or near the center.</p>
<p>It was only with the development, in the 1920s, of better techniques for measuring stellar distances that astronomers finally understood that the universe was much, much larger, consisting of multiple galaxies, among which ours held no special status—just as our Sun, in a spiral arm far from the Milky Way’s center, held no special status among its galactic peers.<a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1"></a></p>

<p>That was a major change. Even so, when I was coming of age a half-century later, the scale of the universe still seemed somewhat manageable. Like millions of other children, I watched Carl Sagan’s <em>Cosmos</em> documentary series in the early 1980s, learning that the universe contains not just a handful of galaxies but at least tens of thousands of them, yet I wouldn’t say that that put an irreparable dent in my belief in human potential. It still seemed conceivable that mankind, with exponentially improving scientific knowledge and technology, could spread outward and someday comprehend—maybe even “conquer”—it all.</p>
<p>The expansion of our cosmic model was still just getting started, though. By the turn of the millennium, with the help of tools like the Hubble Telescope, standard models assumed billions of galaxies. Astronomers also were starting to use the term “observable universe” to delineate the space their telescopes could reach, which, despite its vastness, was apparently incomplete. Indeed, they increasingly embraced the idea that the universe is ever-expanding, and is not just tens or hundreds of billions of light years across but <em>infinite</em>—in all dimensions, presumably including dimensions we can’t perceive.</p>
<p>In a truly infinite cosmos, any local reality would have essentially identical variants elsewhere: “parallel worlds.” As physicist Brian Greene put it in his 2011 book <em>The Hidden Reality</em>, “I find it both curious and compelling that numerous developments in physics, if followed sufficiently far, bump into some variation on the parallel-universe theme.”</p>
<p><strong>MWI</strong></p>
<p>The best-known and most widely held parallel-world theory these days is the “Many Worlds Interpretation” (MWI), initially devised by Hugh Everett III (1930-1982) in the mid-1950s while he was a physics PhD student under John Wheeler at Princeton. Everett’s work was mostly ignored while he was alive, though other physicists, notably Bryce DeWitt and David Deutsch, did much to popularize it later among physicists and the general public—and to extend it and give it its present name.</p>
<p>MWI is called an “interpretation” because it tries to make sense of a conundrum at the heart of quantum mechanics: In certain types of experiment, any quantum-scale particle such as an electron or a photon seems to possess an innate <em>multiplicity</em>. In other words, it manifests as a ghostly ensemble of particles (with different positions and velocities) and only when an experimenter tries to detect it more directly does it stop acting like a ghostly ensemble and resolve to just one particle. The leading interpretation in quantum mechanics’ first half-century or so was that this “collapse” to just one state is induced by the experimenter’s act of observation, and that the other, left-behind states are somehow not real. Everett proposed instead that all these states are real and essentially represent <em>different versions</em> of the particle that end up being captured—by different versions of the experimenter—in different universes. In short, MWI holds that reality consists of multiple universes, in which, collectively, anything that can happen does happen.</p>
<p>Everett’s idea was rejected at first, as new ideas that threaten the status quo and its defenders typically are. But the reaction to MWI wasn’t just the usual circling of the wagons by the old guard. Even many who admired the theory’s elegance were discomfited by it. As Oxford philosopher of physics Simon Saunders said to a reporter in 2007, “The multiverse will drive you crazy if you really think about how it affects your life, and I can’t live like that. I’ll just accept Everett and then think about something else, to save my sanity.”</p>
<p>Still, MWI was and remains elegant and consistent with experimental results. As alternative interpretations of quantum mechanics have fallen by the wayside, it has risen steadily in popularity, not just among physicists but also among science popularizers—and popular audiences, as suggested by the success of the MWI-themed 2023 movie <em>Everything Everywhere All at Once</em>.</p>
<p>MWI recently received further support when Google reported a “quantum supremacy” demonstration by its experimental quantum computer Willow. A feat of quantum supremacy is a feat that a quantum computer—whose computational bits exist not as discrete 0 or 1 bits but in ghostly superpositions of both—can achieve that an ordinary “classical” computer can never match. It is regarded as an empirical proof that quantum computing is real, which for many physicists also bolsters the validity of MWI, because the idea of quantum computing—first developed by Deutsch in the mid 1980s—is that such computers gain their advantage in effect by performing computations across different universes.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">—from Google Quantum AI blog post 9 Dec 2024</p>
<p><strong>A Concealed Toxicity</strong></p>
<p>The scientific and technical elites who have brought us these developments have been, at best, silent about their implications, and at worst, actively deceptive—although maybe they have been deceiving themselves too. As I was rewatching <em>Cosmos</em> (1980) recently, I noticed it was now prefaced by Ann Druyan, Sagan’s widow and a writer and director on the series, who invokes the “soaring spiritual high” of science’s “central revelation: our oneness with the universe.” Essentially every mainstream author or commentator on cosmology has had similarly upbeat things to say—about the beauty of the universe, and/or the cleverness of humans in their recent leaps of discovery. This is not <em>just</em> self-deception—these experts have to sell books and other media content, and publishers want positive themes.</p>
<p>But it <em>is</em> all deceptive. Why? Because, again, science’s central revelation—cosmology’s especially—is the insignificance of humanity, and for MWI and other infinite-cosmos theories this is not just a relative insignificance but an <em>absolute</em>, one-over-infinity insignificance.</p>
<p>The MWI cosmos is, in a technical sense, more splendid and elegant than anything found in human religion. What could be more perfect, what could be more complete, than an infinitude in which everything that can happen does happen? The problem is that this perfect completeness, or maybe unendingness, leaves no room for “purpose,” “meaning,” or “achievement” in any substantive sense. It also mocks our childish notion that we could somehow explore and/or “conquer” it all.</p>
<p>In fact, MWI implies that there is no higher purpose or meaning to any human being’s actions or existence, other than by filling out, in an infinitesimal way, the infinite space of possibility. Are you a good person in this universe? Are you “successful”? How can this be substantially meaningful (from the perspective of a Creator who transcends the multiverse), if otherwise indistinguishable variants of you are bad and unsuccessful in other universes—and presumably average to a mediocrity across all instances? When you combine this “MWI view” with the modern neuroscientific view of behavior—as being determined moment-to-moment by innumerable, mostly subconscious factors while our conscious selves stand by as purblind spectators—you start to get a picture of humans as “non-player-character” (NPC) automata in a sort of video game with infinite parallel playthroughs.</p>
<p>To the extent that people see themselves and their lives from this perspective, they are likely to lose a lot of their motivations for doing things—and not just the great and ambitious things but also the ordinary, pro-social behaviors that keep societies from coming unglued. Such behaviors are rooted in concepts of good and bad, meaning and purpose, and MWI erodes all that as completely as would a revelation that we live in a simulation.</p>
<p>MWI defies our traditional self-image so starkly and extensively that it also calls into question the “<em>sapiens sapiens</em>” label we have given ourselves. Perhaps, when compared to other civ-building species in our galaxy, we aren’t very smart at all. Perhaps our simple ape brains are already nearing the limits of what they can do—limits that fall well short of what even the most basic star-faring endeavors require.</p>
<p><strong>Signs of Despair</strong></p>
<p>Again, big changes in our understanding of our place in the cosmos can take generations to sink in, and MWI and other infinite-cosmos notions began seeping into the popular mind only recently. It may be that only children born in this millennium are being—and have been—forced to confront these ideas in a substantial way during the impressionable years when their models of the world and moral structures come together. If so, it may take another decade or two for this particular form of despair to be recognized as a mass phenomenon, distinguishable from all the other forms of despair out there.</p>
<p>In the meantime, despair is undoubtedly prevalent in our materially prosperous civilization, particularly among the young. “Adolescent mental health continues to worsen” <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthy-youth/mental-health/index.html">reads</a> a recent CDC headline, over a story that notes that in 2023 about 40% of American students had “persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness.” A commission set up by <em>Lancet Psychiatry</em> issued a <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/commissions/youth-mental-health">report</a> last summer concluding that “in many countries, the mental health of young people has been declining over the past two decades, signalling a warning that global megatrends and changes in many societies are increasing mental ill health.” Whatever is driving this pandemic of despair and depression seems also to be promoting “nihilism” and “doomerism&#8221; among the same youthful demographic.<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-531" src="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/nihil-trend.jpg" alt="" width="769" height="226" srcset="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/nihil-trend.jpg 769w, https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/nihil-trend-300x88.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 769px) 100vw, 769px" /></p>

<p>While this putative trend may be attributable mostly to other social and economic disruptions of recent decades—from electronic media overexposure to the high cost of family formation—perhaps some is being driven by science, which after all has been moving in the same direction, displacing religiously based beliefs and ethics, for centuries now. In any case, despair caused by other factors is treatable in principle, whereas the one served up by science seems incurable.</p>
<p>One of my premises here is that the people who built Western civilization couldn’t have done so without believing, at least subconciously, that there is (or probably is) meaning and purpose in life and the universe. If so, then removing that sense of meaning and purpose would likely remove that civ-building dynamism our ancestors had, and the only way to recover meaning and purpose—perhaps the only way for humans to survive, in the long-term—would be to renounce and suppress most science and technology and revert to more primitive social forms.</p>
<p>One would expect to see this cultural arrest and regress play out first in the Western societies that have been the most diligent in jettisoning religion. And indeed, the essentially post-Christian societies of Northwestern Europe now look pretty moribund in most respects compared to their peers; certainly, they lack the “ad astra” energy of the contemporary USA.</p>
<p>The current hoopla over AI raises the question: Couldn’t we create advanced robots and robotic starships that self-replicate and relentlessly explore outer space, without regard for the apparent pointlessness of the endeavor—in fact, without any emotion at all? Yes, in principle, if we could remain motivated long enough to develop the necessary AI and robotics tech. But autonomous robot exploration is not the same as human exploration. Moreover, it’s not hard to imagine these clever creations eventually finishing off their depressed, listless, impotent creators, in a perfect and final example of a “cure” that kills the patient.</p>
<p>The idea that cosmology and other key branches of science eventually become toxic to a technological society offers a solution to Fermi’s Paradox because it is plausible that not only humans but also other intelligent species that emerge in the cosmos and start venturing into space face this same problem—this fundamental conflict between, on the one hand, the self-delusions needed for basic civilization-building and progress, and on the other, the delusion-bursting science needed to reach the stars.</p>
<p>Incidentally, cosmology’s hint about our relative inferiority as a species suggests another, complementary solution: The few star-faring civs that do exist in our vicinity either do not care about us, or, even if they are curious enough to visit, don’t waste time trying to communicate—firstly because we are too primitive to process what they would have to say, and secondly because almost anything they <em>could</em> convey, particularly regarding the nature of the cosmos, would injure us.<strong> </strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>a short history </em><span id="more-517"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The design of RMS <em>Titanic</em>, with its multiple watertight compartments, made it seem, even to experts of the day, “practically unsinkable.” So it proved—right up until the night it sank.</p>
<p>It might now be a good idea to view the American political system with the skepticism that <em>Titanic</em>’s design deserved. Over the past two centuries and a half, as monarchy has faded into the past and autocracy has discredited itself again and again, “democracy” has come to be seen as the <em>only</em> legitimate form of governance, with the American variant—once considered a bold experiment—its shining ideal. Nowadays, that shine is so bright that it is difficult to see the reality that lies behind it. Indeed, in the current cultural environment, anyone questioning the superiority of American democracy, in theory or in practice, is liable to be accused of doing so in the service of “fascism.”</p>
<p>Yet there are many aspects of the contemporary American political structure, such as universal voting rights for citizens 18 years or older, and the “democratization” of the electoral college system, that even the Founders would view skeptically. Why? Because they are changes to the original structure—indeed, are often changes that the Founders specifically did not want.</p>
<p>There are also some features of modern American politics that the Founders, looking out from their simpler 18<sup>th</sup>-century world, simply failed to foresee—features that, like Titanic’s underappreciated vulnerability to an iceberg sideswipe, have the potential to cause the failure of the entire enterprise.</p>
<p>One of these features, I think the most worrisome by far, is the practice of expanding the electorate in a way that advantages one political party over its rivals. It is directly analogous to “court packing” and thus has been called “electorate packing.”</p>
<p>Americans have been very slow to recognize the danger of this political exploit. Although a handful of conservatives warned for decades that the Democrats were using it to create an impenetrable electoral majority in the country, they were, until recently, mostly ignored, even as one state after another (think of California, New Mexico, Colorado and New York) was flooded with non-European immigrants, i.e., Democrat voters, until it turned durably “blue.”</p>
<p>Why have Americans been so passive and unconcerned about electorate-packing? Probably in part because it is not at all a new feature of their politics. Indeed, America’s political history is, to a surprising extent, the history of the use of this tactic—by virtually all parties.</p>
<p><strong>Immigrants as Electoral Weapons</strong></p>
<p>The US at its origin was strikingly underpopulated, compared to most European countries. It also had enormous adjacent territories that it wanted to occupy, and expected to have to defend. It therefore needed more people, and, to attract them, increasingly had to offer them relatively quick acquisition of citizenship and voting rights.</p>
<p>Thus, in the country’s first decades, virtually all parties accepted, at least broadly, the necessity of electorate expansions, firstly from immigration (from Britain and nearby European countries) and secondly from expansions of the franchise—which initially had been limited almost entirely to ≥21-year-old, white, property-owning males.</p>
<p>It wasn’t long, though, before electoral expansions began to be seen as helping some parties more than others. English, Scots, and Welsh immigrants, who were mostly Protestants and were more concentrated in the northeast, tended to prefer the Federalist Party of Hamilton and Adams, while the more numerous Irish and German immigrants—and Catholic immigrants generally—flocked to the Democratic-Republican Party of Jefferson and Madison. The Federalists’ Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798, which greatly stiffened citizenship requirements, were, in part, reactions to an ongoing wave of Irish immigration—and when Jefferson’s party triumphed in the 1800 elections and repealed most of those measures or allowed them to expire, it effectively expanded the Irish vote in its favor. The Federalists never won another presidential election, and by 1820 had faded away.</p>
<p>In the decade that followed, the Democratic-Republican Party also came apart, but its main successor, the Democratic Party, retained the allegiance of Irish and Germans, the top migrant ethnicities of that era. With their help, the Democrats dominated antebellum politics. Immigrant inflows were sometimes strong enough to provoke nativist movements, the largest, in the 1850s, being led by the anti-immigrant American (a.k.a. “Know-Nothing”) Party. But such movements tended to die out when immigrant waves subsided, and the Democrats’ electoral supremacy ended only when they split over slavery in 1860.</p>
<p><strong>Blacks and Women</strong></p>
<p>The War Between the States was, in part, a continuation of the struggle that had emerged in the 1850s between Democrats and their up-and-coming rivals, the Republicans. Even many northern-state Democrats (known as “copperheads”) opposed the war and wanted to let the southern states go. In this sense, it is not too surprising that the Union army’s triumph on the field led to political measures—including a colossal re-engineering of the southern electorate—aimed at ensuring GOP dominance.</p>
<p>President Lincoln had felt that African Americans, following emancipation, should live and govern themselves according to their own ways on their own lands, preferably in Africa. But after Lincoln’s assassination, radicals in the Republican-controlled Congress prevailed with their own plan for the freed slaves. They saw to it that Black men were given US citizenship and voting rights in southern states, even as southern White men’s voting rights were limited—and many former Confederates were barred from holding office. The Republicans set many of these measures in stone by forcing the southern states to ratify the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution. There were moral justifications for all this. But the Republicans also had a strong partisan motive, which, to their political opponents (and to many subsequent historians) was the real driver of their policies and represented an enormous abuse of power.</p>
<p>As Black men became loyal Republican voters during Reconstruction, the many White women who had supported Black suffrage renewed their efforts to win their own voting rights. Here again, the Republicans saw an opportunity for electoral gains. Ultimately, they provided nearly three-quarters of the “yea” votes in Congress for the passage of the 19<sup>th</sup> Amendment, which outlawed voting rights restrictions based on sex, and thereby added tens of millions of women to the electorate.</p>
<p><strong>A Reversal of Fortune</strong></p>
<p>The Democrats reversed these Republican advantages chiefly in three ways: The first was their effective opposition to Reconstruction, which led to their re-capture of southern states, the suppression of the Black vote in those states, and the establishment of the “Jim Crow” racial segregation system. The second, in the 1930s and 40s, was the welfarism of the New Deal, which attracted the votes of many African Americans as well as lower-income voters of all races. The third was the party’s transformation, in the 1960s, into a civil rights party—powered, as the Republican party had been a century before, by an unusual level of political dominance following a presidential assassination. By the 1968 election, Black neighborhoods were voting Democrat at rates approaching 100 percent. The Democrats’ welfare, affirmative action and feminist policies also increasingly endeared them to women.</p>
<p>The Democrats didn’t just capture voters from prior electorate expansions; they also turned this tactic decisively into their own again with the 1965 Hart-Celler Immigration and Nationality Act, which abolished country-of-origin restrictions on immigrants. Combined with affirmative action laws that extended preferences to immigrant nonwhites, this expansion brought another enduring electoral windfall for the Democrats.</p>
<p>In 1971, the Democrat-controlled Congress approved a constitutional amendment that expanded the electorate further by lowering the minimum voting age from 21 to 18. The “old enough to fight, old enough to vote” argument helped make it a relatively non-partisan event, but since younger people tended to vote left, it represented a net gain by the Democrats.</p>
<p>The Republicans, in the decades that followed, tried to improve their image among the newly enfranchised, for example by signing on to various immigration-liberalizing bills, including amnesties for illegal immigrants. It availed them little, as the Democrats maintained a tight grip on every group that had become voters through immigration and other electorate expansions. In the 2012 presidential election, the Democratic candidate (Obama) received 93 percent of the Black vote, 71 percent of the Hispanic vote, 73 percent of the Asian vote, 85 percent of the Muslim vote, 55 percent of the female vote, 63 percent of the low-household-income (&lt;$30K) vote, and 60 percent of the vote among 18-to-29-year-olds. The Republican candidate (Romney), an uncontroversial moderate, therefore lost badly despite getting 59 percent of the white vote—and 62 percent of the white male vote, representing the country’s pre-Civil-War electorate.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-520" src="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/filams.jpg" alt="" width="344" height="352" srcset="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/filams.jpg 314w, https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/filams-293x300.jpg 293w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 344px) 100vw, 344px" /></p>
<p><strong>Feature or bug?</strong></p>
<p>What happened next is very recent history: In the runup to the 2016 election, Republicans—and even many independents and Democrats—belatedly perceived how seriously immigration-based electorate-packing had imperiled them, and chose the most anti-immigration leader available, overlooking his many flaws. He won an upset victory in the 2016 presidential election, but made no lasting progress in his first term. When the Democrats took over again, they moved towards endgame with an overt open-borders policy. The Democrats’ power, however, was limited by their own dissident legislators (Manchin, Sinema) and the Republicans were spared the mass amnesty for illegals that Democrats had planned. The Democrats’ complacent extremism also began to repel many of the voters they thought they owned <em>en bloc</em>. Thus, Republicans were given another reprieve in 2024—and vowed that this time they would really fix things.</p>
<p>It is tempting to conclude from all this that occasional electorate expansions, and subsequent partisan tussles over those new voters, may be messy but are essentially ordinary aspects of a modern republic. American politics has, over time, featured a variety of electoral cheats and hacks including vote-buying, ballot-harvesting, and the stuffing of ballot-boxes with fake ballots, yet the country is wealthy compared to most Western peers, and its citizens still consider it mostly functional and “democratic.” Also, few Americans now would question the legitimacy of all the citizenship and/or voting rights extensions since their country’s founding.</p>
<p>On the other hand, all these extensions were at least somewhat controversial in their day. Most should have been, since electoral expansions that principally benefit one party have the same effect—and typically the same intent—as large-scale, long-term vote-buying, and are much less reversible. They are in principle as unfair as the “court-packing” of the Supreme Court that both FDR and Joe Biden threatened and backed away from.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, though, the Democrats’ aggressive electorate-packing attempts over the past four years have given us glimpses (e.g., Haitians in Ohio) of the <em>Camp of the Saints</em> dystopia to which this tactic seems to want to take us.</p>
<p>This is, then, an issue that the incoming Trump administration should prioritize, since the Democrats can be expected to resume their open-borders electorate-packing measures, without compunction, if they ever again control Congress and the White House. If Republicans want to talk about somehow blocking or outlawing this practice, though, they should probably start by acknowledging their party’s prominent role in normalizing its use.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">About a hundred fair Julys ago—it seems that long anyway—I ran with the bulls in Pamplona.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">If you&#8217;d asked me <em>why</em> back then, I would have said simply that it seemed a fun thing to do, a thrill, an &#8220;experience&#8221; to tick off a tourist&#8217;s list. It would have felt silly to describe it as a chance to prove one&#8217;s courage. But I think that is mainly what it was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">We bull-runners were all men or boys. Nearly all of us wore the traditional uniform of the <em>encierro</em> (thin white cotton shirt, red bandanna). Many of us also carried a rolled-up newspaper, said to be useful for distracting the bull with a swat to the hindquarters if he happened to be goring a friend.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-31" src="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/pamplona1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="266" srcset="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/pamplona1.jpg 400w, https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/pamplona1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">A rocket went off and burst to warn us as the first bulls were released from a pen into the zigzag course of the town&#8217;s narrow streets. The animals had to pound down a lane and round a corner before they encountered most of the human runners who waited for them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">Now here they came. Who knew how fast those half-ton monsters moved? We runners lurched forward, with the twin fears of injury on the one hand and cowardice on the other. To avoid both, it certainly helped to be in a group. Running alone, becoming the sole target of all those horned beasts, was almost inconceivable. But there was danger too in being amid a jostling pack: many runners stumbled and fell with, it seemed, too little time to rise and evade what approached with such inhuman speed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">And suddenly that first group of bulls and steers rumbled by, all hooves and bulk and undulant muscle. Like most of the runners, I had managed to get to one side of the narrow, cobblestoned street to let them pass. Some other runners, though, were caught in the middle and sent sprawling. A miraculous few stayed up, jogging gamely, as the great beasts missed them by inches.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-467" src="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/encierro1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="596" srcset="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/encierro1.jpg 400w, https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/encierro1-201x300.jpg 201w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">I ran again, found daylight, heard the next pack coming, let them pass, and just managed to sprint into the <em>plaza de toros</em> before the last bulls entered and the gate closed behind them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-460" src="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/Pamplona-1947.gif" alt="" width="320" height="240" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">To my surprise, if no one else’s, a series of younger bulls was then let out to confront the few dozen of us who had made it into the bullring. One of the first animals took aim at a German tourist—a scruffy-looking character, <em>borracho </em>and slow—and chased him down easily, driving him face-first into the dirt. The guy might well have been killed, had the young bull’s horns not been padded. Later the same animal, chasing one of us, leapt over the plaza&#8217;s <em>barrera</em> and raced around forcing panicked bullring staff and spectators to spill into the comparative safety of the bullring itself. We runners laughed with relief as we took a breather, but soon were eager for the next <em>novillo toro</em> to be let out so that this primal test of our courage could start again.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-443" src="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/goya.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="372" srcset="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/goya.jpg 600w, https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/goya-300x186.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">At the time it seemed a forgiving test. It was clear that tourists in the <em>encierro,</em> especially the drunk ones, were routinely gored or trampled, but I assumed that truly serious or fatal injuries were very rare. There wasn&#8217;t yet an Internet with which one could immediately <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/24/man-killed-during-bull-run-in-spain-pushes-death-toll-to-10-so-far-for-year">check </a>such <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Travel/story?id=118926&amp;page=1">statistics</a>. Even at the real bullfights, in the afternoons at Pamplona, where the bulls were injured and maddened and vengeful, the matadors appeared to be in little danger; one of them kept such a cautious distance between the bull&#8217;s horns and his own costumed hide that the spectators began to hurl insults—<em>maric</em><em>ó</em><em>n! el peor!</em>—and even seat cushions into the ring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">However, some Spanish bullfighters were reputed to be very skillful and brave. Among them was Jose Cubero (“El Yiyo”) Sanchez. Later that summer, in southwestern France, I saw posters listing him in the lineup for a <em>corrida</em> to be held in Bayonne in September.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">Alas, Sanchez didn’t make it to Bayonne, or even to September. On the 30<sup>th</sup> of August, in Madrid, he was nearing the end of a seemingly routine bout when he attempted the ritual sword-thrust, which is meant to go into the bull’s upper back and thence downward through the heart. He missed. The angry bull turned, charged, upended the matador, and—as the 21-year old tried to scramble away on all fours—stuck him with his left horn in the upper back. In full view of a large crowd, the bull lifted Sanchez completely off his feet so that he slid down the horn until his own heart was pierced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-444" src="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/yiyomuerte.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="337" srcset="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/yiyomuerte.jpg 600w, https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/yiyomuerte-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">Having done his work, the bull let the man go. Sanchez ran just a few steps before collapsing, famously gasping his last words, &#8220;este toro me ha matado,&#8221; as they rushed him in vain to the ring infirmary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">Those memories came back last week when I read about the unfortunate Victor Barrio, the first matador to die in the bullring since Sanchez.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">It happened at a late-night <em>corrida</em> in Teruel. Towards the end of a fight with a bull called Lorenzo, Barrio goaded the bleeding, wary animal to charge the cape. The bull at last did as he was bidden, but as Barrio swiveled for the next pass, Lorenzo without warning shifted his attention from cape to matador—some later spoke of an unlucky, cape-lifting gust of wind—and with an upthrusting left horn to the back of the knee the bull sent his human tormentor leaping evasively into the air.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-445" src="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/barrio-upended.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="309" srcset="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/barrio-upended.jpg 500w, https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/barrio-upended-300x185.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">It was a relatively minor goring, but the bull was not finished. The moment the matador hit the dirt, Lorenzo, using the same left horn, began trying to stab him in the chest. Barrio started to roll away but Lorenzo quickly hooked him below the right arm and, hopping on front hooves to make full use of his 529-kg weight, drove the horn most of the way through the man’s chest cavity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-446" src="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/barrio-gored-600.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="327" srcset="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/barrio-gored-600.jpg 600w, https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/barrio-gored-600-300x164.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">Lorenzo then jerked the embedded horn sideways for good measure, destroying Barrio’s right lung and thoracic aorta among other things, and violently lifting his body off the ground. When, just about six seconds after making that first sudden stab to the leg, Lorenzo flung his conquered adversary off his horn, the 29-year old matador had only enough time to pull his arm over the wound in his side and roll over, face down, before darkness overcame him. He died in full view of the crowd, his eyes opening sightlessly, his muscles relaxing into the flaccidity that in traditional societies marks the release of the soul to heaven.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">In bullfights, incidentally, that is the ideal ending: the killer’s thrust swiftly stops the victim’s heart. Perhaps no bull has ever turned the tables as perfectly as Lorenzo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">And Lorenzo as far as I know had never practiced fighting humans. Like the brother taurus that killed Sanchez, he seemed to know from long-evolved instinct to use his horns to maximum effect by going, when he could, for his antagonist’s chest. As any hunter or soldier will tell you, the chest of a mammal is the prime kill zone, easily hit and especially vulnerable to mortal wounds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">In the <em>plaza de toros</em> at Teruel that night, it all happened too quickly for the spectators to process. Barrio had been gored somehow and was down&#8212;that was obvious. But there was no visible gush of blood. That this was because his heart had almost immediately been stopped was unimaginable. The man had been standing, smoothly handling the bull with his cape just a few moments before. His young wife, though she was seated even closer to the action than most other spectators, assumed her husband’s wounds <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3687837/Widow-Spanish-bullfighter-gored-death-eyes-reveals-couple-planned-try-children-September.html">couldn’t</a> be fatal.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">“I was saying to myself, ‘It’s serious but he’s going to survive, he’s been gored, but nowadays no-one dies from being gored, there’ll be a solution.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">**</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">No one dies? What then would be the point? As Hemingway observed, “Bullfighting is the only art in which the artist is in danger of death.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-447" src="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/hemingway-encierro.jpg" alt="" width="574" height="402" srcset="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/hemingway-encierro.jpg 574w, https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/hemingway-encierro-300x210.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">Barrio and Sanchez surely knew that—knew about the danger, at least, even if they also knew that bullfighting doesn’t always rise to the level of art.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">Alas, these days, talk of danger and art are mostly lost on the audience beyond the bullring. The <em>bien pensants</em> of social media heaped scorn on Barrio and bullfighting in response to the story of his death.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-448" src="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/anti-tauromaq.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="334" srcset="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/anti-tauromaq.jpg 400w, https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/anti-tauromaq-300x251.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">Even in Spain, the rapid modern shifts in customs—largely driven, as elsewhere, by the cultural ascendancy of women—have meant that bullfighting is treated more and more as a bloody relic of a barbarous past.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-449" src="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/peta-protesters.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="334" srcset="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/peta-protesters.jpg 500w, https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/peta-protesters-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">Bullfighting is undeniably cruel, and sometimes can seem irredeemably so. At Pamplona all those years ago, I saw one bull killed in a most unsporting way, which was nevertheless common: The swords had all missed so that the matador, amid the crowd&#8217;s jeers, had finally to sever the poor kneeling animal’s spinal cord with a dagger to put it out of its misery. And still the bloody travesty continued: When they tried to hook the bull’s carcass to a team of horses that would drag it from the ring, someone slapped the horses prematurely, before the attachment was made. The horses sprinted forward, unloaded and out of control, until the one on the far right smashed against the edge of the arena’s exit, and was left writhing on the ground with serious injuries. Someone then had to come out and put <em>it</em> out of its misery, with a pistol if memory serves. It seemed a horrible waste&#8212;though almost incredibly it was much worse a century ago, when the picadors&#8217; horses went unpadded and were often gored so badly that their intestines spilled out and dragged on the sand behind them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">And yet I can&#8217;t join the anti-tauromaquian chorus. I&#8217;m not a Spaniard and I&#8217;m generally loath to criticize other cultures&#8212;to each his own, I&#8217;m inclined to say. More specifically I think bullfighting is too ancient, and potentially too beneficial, to just throw away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">Bullfighting is many things. It is for example a drama&#8212;Hemingway called it a tragedy&#8212;symbolizing the eternal contest between man and beast: brains vs. brawn. Plausibly it also represents the higher, more hopeful struggle of mankind vs. its own mortality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">Most straightforwardly, though, bullfighting is a highly ritualized, indeed professionalized elaboration of simple, prove-your-courage-with-a-deadly-beast displays—displays that are still largely preserved in the public <em>encierros</em> at Pamplona and other Spanish towns, but that date back to prehistoric times. Ancient Mediterranean cultures are suffused with themes involving bulls and men, typically in conflict. The most famous surviving artifacts of the early bronze-age Minoan culture, of roughly 3,500 years ago, feature very <em>encierro</em>-like &#8220;bull leaping&#8221; activities.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-451" src="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/bull-leaper-fresco.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="554" srcset="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/bull-leaper-fresco.jpg 900w, https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/bull-leaper-fresco-300x185.jpg 300w, https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/bull-leaper-fresco-768x473.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">Arguably the basic meme of man vs. bull dates back all the way to humans&#8217; earliest surviving narrative tale, the <em>Epic of Gilgamesh</em>, which is about 4,000 years old.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">The Bull seemed indestructible, for hours they fought, till Gilgamesh dancing in front of the Bull, lured it with his tunic and bright weapons, and Enkidu thrust his sword, deep into the Bull&#8217;s neck, and killed it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">There is little in this rich history to suggest that bullfighting, or even the bull-running and bull-teasing of <em>encierros</em>, have as their aim the &#8220;torture&#8221; of beasts for perverse enjoyment, or the competition of “sport,” or even the attainment of &#8220;artistry.&#8221; All those can be (and generally are) realized in other ways that are much less dangerous to the practitioner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">It is that danger, that risk of grave injury or death, and the simple, primal manifestation of that risk in a powerful animal, that makes bullfighting and related amateur activities unique. One social benefit is that it teaches men the possibility of courage in themselves; it glorifies that courage as something worth having; and it evokes the ancient past in which such courage was utterly necessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">Is courage so valueless these days that we can afford to part with practices that encourage it? How could we ever be sure?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">**</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">If bullfighting statistics are any guide, then we the men of the West&#8212;considering matadors as our proxies&#8212;are losing our courage. <a href="https://thelastarena.wordpress.com/2015/02/25/533-professional-bullfighters-killed-in-the-ring-since-1700/">More than 500</a> professional bullfighters have been killed in the ring since 1700, but only a handful of those deaths have occurred in the last half-century. Better medical care for wounded matadors and an improving economy (which makes bullfighting less attractive as a career choice) have something to do with that discrepancy, but surely not everything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">Another factor seems to be that matadors are on average less willing to work in close proximity to bulls&#8212;that has been part of <em>aficionados&#8217;</em> litany for much of the past century, as the great names of bulfighting&#8217;s heyday have faded into memory. There have also been, it is said, more of the shady tricks that weaken bulls before they get to the ring. Among these is <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/out-of-spain-matadors-on-horns-of-a-dilemma-1393519.html">horn-shaving</a>, a practice that Hemingway <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Death-Afternoon-Ernest-Hemingway/dp/0684801450/">described </a>thusly:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">To protect the leading matadors, the bulls&#8217; horns had been cut off at the points and then shaved and filed down so that they looked like real horns. But they were as tender at the points as a fingernail that has been cut to the quick and if the bull could be made to bang them against the planks of the barrera, they would hurt so that he would be careful about hitting anything else. . .</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">Even Manolete, often considered the greatest matador of all time, was sometimes protected this way. In the 1930s and 40s his bullfights brought in so much revenue that he became an industry in his own right&#8212;and that industry didn&#8217;t want to lose its key man.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">But if Manolete&#8217;s reputation suffered a bit from the shaving, his fatal goring in 1947 redeemed it. Late in an August bout at Linares, boldly reaching over the bull&#8217;s head to drive in a sword, the 30-year old matador was nicked by a horn in his groin and began bleeding badly from his femoral artery. The bloodstain spread quickly down his left leg.<br />
</span></p>
<div style="width: 434px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-21-1" width="434" height="358" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/Manolete-Muerte-1.m4v?_=1" /><a href="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/Manolete-Muerte-1.m4v">https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/Manolete-Muerte-1.m4v</a></video></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">Manolete nevertheless stayed up, kept the bull working, and finally, with the animal close to death, limped away and was carried to the infirmary.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;"><a href="http://whenwordsmatter.typepad.com/before_their_time/2012/12/manuel-rodriguez-sanchez-better-known-as-manolete-stepped-wearily-to-the-microphone-in-an-ante-room-of-the-san-sebastian.html">As he lay</a> in the infirmary, Manolete lit a cigarette and asked in a weak voice, &#8220;Is the bull dead?&#8221; After being informed that the bull was, indeed, dead, Manolete said that he could not feel his legs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">These days he would have survived such an injury, but his ultimate reputation would have suffered: his decline and death would have been more drawn-out, and certainly less interesting. As it was, Manolete (whose real surname was Sanchez) died of his injury the next morning, and passed into everlasting glory.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-453" src="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/death-of-manolete.jpg" alt="" width="359" height="322" srcset="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/death-of-manolete.jpg 359w, https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/death-of-manolete-300x269.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">Juan Belmonte (1892-1962), the <em>other</em> greatest-ever matador, may have envied Manolete&#8217;s end. Belmonte despite a long career and many serious gorings retired safely, and, it seemed, lived a life not unlike that of the rare fighting bull that is spared death and put out to stud. He bought a ranch and raised horses on it, and was rich. But he kept un-retiring and resuming bullfighting again, and being injured again, and retiring again, and then un-retiring, and so on as if nothing else in life measured up to the fundamental challenge of the bullring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: book antiqua,palatino,serif;">Eventually in 1962, when Belmonte was 70 and in failing health, his doctor advised him to stop riding horses and performing other manly exertions. According to the dressed-up legend, which in a cultural sense may be more revealing than the facts, the old matador went defiantly out to his ranch, indulged one last time in horse-riding, cigar-smoking, drinking, and sex with a pair of young women, and then&#8212;like his late pal Hemingway&#8212;shot himself, there being no bull, or matador, available to take his life for him.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Originally published Nov 22, 2015</em></span></p>
<p>It is now routine for Western governments to describe Islamic militants’ attacks on Western civilians as “cowardly.” Unfortunately that description tells us less about the militants than it does about the Western establishment: in particular its tendency towards doublespeak, self-contradiction, and head-in-the-sand ignorance. The acts of people who willingly die for their beliefs are anything but cowardly.</p>
<p>The West’s leaders&#8212;showing off a trait of cultural blindness that dates back through Magellan and Columbus&#8212;cannot understand their foes. They cannot accept that a reasonable person could ever loathe the West&#8217;s &#8220;advanced,&#8221; &#8220;progressive&#8221; culture with its compassion for the oppressed and expansive civil liberties. “Don’t those Muslims get that they’re on the wrong side of history?”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-122" src="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/oppressed.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="300" srcset="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/oppressed.jpg 600w, https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/oppressed-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>No doubt the pagan Romans were as puzzled by the martyrdoms of abstemious early Christians. Why die for a faith that “oppresses” you so?</p>
<p>The truth to which progressivism blinds the West is that Islam, like any historically normal culture, gives structure and meaning to the lives of its adherents. It does that in part by regulating what they must and must not do. Muslims want that structure and meaning more than they want personal freedom. In that sense, they do not see their culture’s rules as oppressions.</p>
<p>Indeed many of them would say that the West is the true oppressor, not only because it invades their lands, kills their children, and co-opts their leaders, but also because it exerts a corrosive and pervasive cultural influence. Even in the so-called Islamic world one cannot escape the smug droning of CNN, the licentiousness of Western advertisers, any more than Orwell’s Winston Smith could escape the ubiquitous telescreens and slogans of Big Brother.</p>
<p>But arguably Western progressivism is not just a culture engaged in the usual competition against other cultures. To the extent that it is about expanding individual liberties at the expense of traditional communal structures and meanings, it might best be described as an <em>anti-culture&#8212;</em>a dissolver of other cultures, not a true culture that can sustain itself in the long run. Its strictures concerning insensitive, politically incorrect speech suggest an attempt to entrench itself with Thou Shalt Not laws&#8212;the sort of thing that ordinary cultures do. But ultimately it doesn&#8217;t have a full and coherent set of the kinds of rules that hold societies together. How could it be a bona fide, logically consistent culture and still be &#8220;multicultural&#8221;? Also, like other forms of materialism (e.g., Marxism), progressivism denies and opposes key aspects of human nature, and thus for that reason too can&#8217;t be expected to last. Human nature is flexible, but has a tendency to snap back violently when pushed too far.</p>
<p>The evidence of the Western anti-culture’s severe conflict with its human hosts is all around us. There are, most obviously, the adverse reactions from Islamic and other societies whose traditional structures it threatens. There are many blowups too from Islamic and other traditional-society immigrants living in the anti-cultural West. But every few weeks now some native, nominally modern person in a Western country (usually the &#8220;freest&#8221; country, the USA) also goes berserk and starts shooting people. These modern shooters often are unable to articulate why they did what they did&#8212;the anti-culture has taken away their vocabulary for that; they have no equivalent of <em>Allahu Akbar</em>!</p>
<p>Progressives exploit these atrocities to advance their agenda by blaming &#8220;guns.&#8221; But there were plenty of guns in pre-anticulture America (say, the 1950s) yet there weren&#8217;t all these mass shootings. It seems much more plausible to blame these incidents on progressivism itself, for its dissolution of traditional Western culture has left nearly everyone in the West adrift and alienated to some extent. As in the Muslim world, some will experience that loss of structure and meaning more acutely than others, and will react with rage and despair.</p>
<p>The mass shooters and their victims are the most visible casualties of this rage and despair. But many thousands of others act it out by harming only themselves, using opioids, alcohol, excessive food, even guns. The mortality <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/03/health/death-rates-rising-for-middle-aged-white-americans-study-finds.html?_r=0">statistics </a>are now showing this curious manifestation of societal collapse. Meanwhile the morbidity <a href="http://www.nndc.org/initiatives/task-groups/women-mood-disorders/">statistics </a>reveal a mood and anxiety disorder pandemic among the West’s women&#8212;those lucky women whom modernity has “liberated” from traditional patriarchal oppression.</p>
<p>How does militant Islam most hurt the people of the modern West? By distracting them from their greater foe, their foe within.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Why has America changed so dramatically over the past fifty years?</em></p>
<p><span id="more-476"></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><em>Originally published June 16, 2014.</em></span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-155" src="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/motherland.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="514" srcset="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/motherland.jpg 400w, https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/motherland-233x300.jpg 233w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>“Suppose truth is a woman—what then?” asked Nietzsche with a chuckle.</p>
<p>His aim, in that opening line of <i>Beyond Good and Evil</i>, was to tell us something about truth. But in so doing he touched on some old assumptions about women: their inconstancy, their irrationality. The dogmas of the day, Nietzsche meant, were neither as immutable nor as reasoned as people assumed.</p>
<p>That skepticism was a lit fuse that led to the destruction of many traditions, including, ironically, men’s traditional underestimation of the fairer sex. Women soon got the vote in Western countries. In one world war and then another, they entered the workforce en masse, and increasingly stayed there during peacetime. Slowly but surely they took positions of influence, becoming doctors and lawyers, editors and producers, novelists and journalists, CEOs and politicians—even presidential candidates.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-156" src="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/fred-graph-men.png" alt="" width="380" height="233" srcset="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/fred-graph-men.png 380w, https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/fred-graph-men-300x184.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 380px) 100vw, 380px" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-157" src="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/fred-graph-women.png" alt="" width="378" height="228" srcset="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/fred-graph-women.png 378w, https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/fred-graph-women-300x181.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 378px) 100vw, 378px" /></p>
<p>By 1985, a century after <i>Beyond Good and Evil</i> was published, more women than men were graduating from college in the United States—and that gender gap would keep getting bigger.</p>
<p>This relatively quick and historically unprecedented surge of women into public life—and, in recent decades, into positions of strong cultural influence—must have had significant cultural consequences. Culture regulates the way that people think and act, especially in public life, and women tend to think and act differently than men, so it follows that their new influence should have shifted Western culture, feminizing it to some degree. Why has so little, if anything, been written and said about this shift?</p>
<p>One could hardly argue that there is no shift to explain. Here are just some of the major social changes that have occurred in the past fifty years in the US—changes that seem quite sudden in historical terms:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Widespread dependence on government: More than 100 million Americans now receive means-tested federal welfare <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/cpstables/032012/perinc/pinc07_000.htm">benefits</a>, which don’t include Social Security or veterans benefits. About 47 million Americans receive <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/food-stamps/">food stamp</a>s. Close to <a href="http://moneymorning.com/2013/04/10/5-charts-show-alarming-trend-in-number-of-americans-collecting-social-security/">six percent</a> of the U.S. working age population now receives <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/social-security-disability-depleted/2013/12/17/id/542390/">payments</a> from the Social Security disability fund, <a href="http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2013-04-03/news/bs-ed-goldberg-disability-20130404_1_disability-insurance-disability-program-social-security-disability-benefits">compared</a> to less than one percent in 1960. In <a href="http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/the_work_versus_welfare_trade-off_2013_wp.pdf">most states</a>, welfare recipients can receive income well above the minimum wage equivalent. All in all, entitlement spending (including related debt-servicing payments) now absorbs about 70% of the federal budget, up from about 30% in 1960. However, the poverty rate is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_in_the_United_States#mediaviewer/File:Number_in_Poverty_and_Poverty_Rate_1959_to_2011._United_States..PNG">about the same</a> as it was in 1965. Meanwhile the labor participation rate for men (see blue chart above) has been falling more or less steadily and is at all time lows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-158" src="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/welfare-nation.png" alt="" width="237" height="281" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-159" src="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/disability-nation.png" alt="" width="369" height="307" srcset="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/disability-nation.png 369w, https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/disability-nation-300x250.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 369px) 100vw, 369px" /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Civil rights expansions and set-asides: including minority-preference affirmative action hiring and contracting policies, “hate crime” laws, the Supreme Court finding that the Constitution effectively bars state laws against gay marriage (and child rearing), the admission of women into combat units in the military, plus the extralegal social ostracism of any public figure uttering politically incorrect speech.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Abandonment of traditional restrictions on immigration: In the early 1960s most immigrants to the US came from Europe or Canada and thus reflected the ethnicities of the existing American population. Since 1965, immigration laws and policies have become much more liberal, resulting in a radical change in the ethnic/cultural influx. Now the top five sources of immigrants are Mexico (dwarfing all others), China, India, the Philippines and Vietnam. The foreign born population in the US, as a percentage of the total population, is almost three times what it was in 1960. From 1960 to now Hispanics have increased their percentage of the population from 3.6% to 16.4%. The number of illegal, undocumented immigrants in America is also now huge, apparently between 10 and 20 million—equivalent to a medium-sized city’s worth of illegals <em>per state</em>. Not only the dynamic economy but also the growth of welfare programs in the US have created huge incentives for immigrants both legal and illegal. Some states even allow illegal immigrants to have <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/04/us-usa-california-immigration-idUSBRE99301I20131004">driver’s licenses</a> and <a href="http://www.nysenate.gov/report/what-benefits-can-illegal-aliens-receive">taxpayer-subsidized benefits</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-161" src="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/immigrant-tuition.png" alt="" width="322" height="307" srcset="https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/immigrant-tuition.png 322w, https://james-the-obscure.github.io/wp-content/uploads/immigrant-tuition-300x286.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px" /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">A decline in the acceptability of military deaths and judicial executions: In all the years of US military activity in Kuwait, Iraq and Afghanistan—which is to say, almost continuously from 1991 to the present—there have been only about 5,400 US combat deaths. And that has been scarcely tolerable, even though about 50,000 Americans died in Vietnam, 300,000 in World War II, and 600,000+ in the Civil War. Meanwhile capital punishment is clearly <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21601258-how-america-canand-willabolish-death-penalty-dismantling-machinery-death">on the way out</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">A nation of victims: Declaring oneself a victim of something terrible—even something <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Million_Little_Pieces">self-inflicted</a>—has become a major theme in American culture: in media stories, in modern psychiatry (PTSD and other trauma-related ailments), and even in contemporary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lovely_Bones">literature</a> where it has dominated for years. Meanwhile on campus, some consider any text a potential source of trauma and victimization, requiring “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/us/warning-the-literary-canon-could-make-students-squirm.html?">trigger warnings</a>” to protect the sensitive.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">A shift in foreign policy: The US has always been evangelical about its ideals, sometimes to the detriment of relations with countries that would otherwise be allies. That is true more than ever today, but the “American ideals” being pushed on countries like Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan and Kenya now include <a href="http://www.state.gov/s/gwi/">women’s rights</a> and even <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2014/05/226253.htm">LGBT rights.</a> Since 1997, the State Department has usually been headed by a woman (Albright, Rice, Clinton).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Back to nature: From Rachel Carson to Global Warming and the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/05/us/on-hawaii-a-lonely-quest-for-facts-about-gmos.html">anti-GMO movement</a>, Americans have become energized about environmental issues as never before. The increase in environmental consciousness has been accompanied by an increasing preference for more “natural” foods and medicines. At the same, more and more Americans have been joining New Ageish, nature-oriented religions, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicca">Wicca</a>, which is often described as the <a href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/267495">fastest-growing religion</a> in the country. This rise in freewheeling nature-oriented religions has been accompanied by declines in traditional, hierarchical Christian denominations such as <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/2013/03/13/strong-catholic-identity-at-a-four-decade-low-in-us/">Roman Catholicism</a>, <a href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/episcopal-church-continues-downward-trend-according-to-report-107906/">Episcopalianism</a> and <a href="http://juicyecumenism.com/2013/08/02/lutheran-exceptionalism-from-hope-to-decline/">Lutheranism</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">New modes of public argument: Debate over public policy these days seems to have less and less to do with sober calculations of long term consequences, and more and more to do with dramatic anecdotes that make immediate appeal to our empathy: the poor immigrant yearning for a new start in the land of freedom; the inmate facing inhumane execution, who just might be innocent; the gay couple who want only to be treated the same as their straight-couple friends; the rape victims of Rwanda or the Congo, or the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/11/us/2-ex-navy-football-players-face-court-martial-in-rape-case.html">US Naval Academy</a>. There is also now a heavy emphasis on protests and marches, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/05/us/politics/michelle-obama-confronts-heckler-at-fund-raiser.html?">heckling</a>, <a href="http://archive.citizen-times.com/article/20110822/NEWS/308210061/Thousands-flock-Asheville-rally-see-women-bare-their-breasts">breast-baring</a>, blood- and egg-throwing, ad hominem attacks, silencings of would-be speakers, and other non-rational or even anti-rational tactics.</p>
<p><strong>Empathy and compassion</strong></p>
<p>Many of these changes are consistent with a cultural shift in favor of empathetic compassion. America over the past few decades has somehow acquired more and more sensitivity to the needs and claims of traditionally disadvantaged minority groups, would-be immigrants and illegals, those who claim to have experienced trauma or injury—basically anyone with a sob story.</p>
<p>This is the precisely the change that we should most expect as women gain greater influence over policy and the wider culture. A greater tendency towards empathy and compassion are among the most distinctive features of the female mindset. Even Aristotle, 2,400 years ago, noted that woman was “more compassionate” and “more easily moved to tears.”</p>
<p>This type of sensitivity presumably is a deep trait that evolved because it is adaptive for child-rearing. Certainly it is common for women to display that trait when raising a child, for example in shielding the child from challenges or risks to which a more coldly rational father is willing to expose him. The Cambridge University psychologist Simon Baron-Cohen, who researches gender differences, has long <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Essential-Difference-Female-Brains/dp/046500556X/">argued</a> that “[t]he female brain is predominantly hard-wired for empathy. The male brain is predominantly hard-wired for understanding and building systems.”</p>
<p>Note that the empathy that moves one to compassion tends to have a certain emotional narrowness and immediacy: “I feel your pain.” It’s not a deliberate, logical weighing of long-term consequences, and it typically is meant to ameliorate the plight of an individual or narrowly defined group, with little thought for wider implications.</p>
<p>America’s immigration policy, to take one example, was once largely based on considerations of long-term consequences, including the adverse social consequences of bringing in millions of people from Third World societies. That policy, now deemed racist, has been replaced by a policy that is to a great extent about satisfying the immediate needs and aspirations of individual immigrants. Ditto for welfare, where the policy tends to focus more on the immediate claims of claimants and less on the adverse society-wide consequences (reducing motivation to work, eroding families, busting budgets). Ditto again for admitting women to combat roles in the military—which is about fulfilling the aspirations of a small number of individuals rather than optimizing the services’ overall warfighting capability.</p>
<p>I would be surprised if the new influence of women on American culture were the <i>only</i> factor in this shift towards more empathy-based attitudes and policies. Television, for example, which spread widely into US homes beginning in the 1960s, has tended to bias debates in favor of the side that can muster more compelling visual images—and videos of people expressing strong emotions tend to be more compelling than, say, bar charts depicting long term consequences. But I wonder if TV’s influence could have been as great, had policymakers and persuaders not become so receptive to that influence—because they were increasingly female.</p>
<p><b>Environmentalism and witchery</b></p>
<p>Pregnancy brings out some remarkable instinctive behaviors that give us further hints about the “hardwired” traits of women. I am referring to the smell and taste aversions that appear mainly in the first trimester, and the “<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/labor-and-delivery/in-depth/signs-of-labor/art-20046184?pg=2">nesting instinct</a>” that occurs in the second or third. None of these behaviors is deliberate and rational—that is what can make them so disturbing to the pregnant woman and her loved ones—but they appear to have evolved to help keep the baby safe from toxins, germs and other harmful environmental influences.</p>
<p>I suggest—that is all I can do at this point; there is little published research in this area—that these deeply rooted traits, which appear to be influenced by levels of estrogen and related hormones, would also manifest to some extent outside pregnancy. They would show up, for example, in a tendency to be more concerned (than men are) about putative environmental threats.</p>
<p>Again, there is no definitive research on this question. But there is some evidence that women (compared to men) tend to put <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jun/13/opinion/la-oe-polakovic-gender-and-the-environment-20120613">more emphasis on pro-environmental issues</a>, are less likely to <a href="http://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2010/study-women-more-likely-than-men-to-accept-global-warming/">be global warming skeptics</a>, and are more likely to choose<a href="http://www.environmentalleader.com/2011/04/14/women-more-likely-to-choose-eco-packaging/"> eco-packaging</a>. Women also are heavily represented in pro-environment groups such as Greenpeace and the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/05/us/on-hawaii-a-lonely-quest-for-facts-about-gmos.html?_r=0">anti-GMO</a> movement.</p>
<p>Related to this “green” tendency may be women’s seemingly greater aversion (on average, compared to men) towards modern, industrially produced foods and medicines, and the recent, swift rise in popularity of “natural” alternatives—purchased <a href="http://community.babycenter.com/post/a31051537/more_women_buy_organic_foods_than_men">mostly</a> by <a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/news/camstats/2007/camsurvey_fs1.htm">women</a>.</p>
<p>The trend towards natural remedies appears to be related to New Age and witchcraft religions with their pre-scientific, eye-of-newt style systems of “healing.” These alternative religions obviously strike other chords in some women, and while I’m no expert on the matter, presumably one attraction is that the new religions give women more interesting and flexible roles than they would have had in traditional, patriarchal Christianity (e.g., lusty witch vs. celibate nun).</p>
<p>The same suspicions of modern, technologically produced food and medicine appear to have encouraged the ongoing anti-vaccine <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/22/opinion/bruni-autism-and-the-agitator.html">movement</a>, and the <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/detox-diets/faq-20058040">spurious</a> “<a href="http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-plans/gywneth-paltrow-diet-detox">detox</a>” intestinal cleansing fad, both of which have been largely female social phenomena, heavily promoted by female celebrities such as Jenny McCarthy and Gwyneth Paltrow.</p>
<p><strong>Unreason, contagion, victimization</strong></p>
<p>In the list of big social changes above, I mentioned an apparent trend towards the use of non-rational or even anti-rational tactics in public arguments: for example, the demonization and silencing of opponents as alternatives to reasoned debate, and the rejection of due process in many cases where women are the accusers and men the accused. Is this too part of our cultural feminization? Historically men have believed that women are less rational, less reason-guided, in contexts where they are trying to persuade. Obviously this notion is offensive to modern women and to a great extent it does stem from the casual misogyny of the past. Then again, every modern study I’ve seen that touches on this particular question—check out <a href="https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ914830">this one</a> from 2003—suggests that women are indeed markedly less supportive of free speech rights, and more emotionally sensitive to speech with which they disagree.</p>

<p>From an anthropological perspective, it makes perfect sense that women and men in the course of human evolution would have acquired (again: on average—think of two overlapping Bell curves) cognitive and other psychological differences, stemming from differences in their traditional roles, e.g., women as nurturers vs. men as hunters, warriors and leaders. In particular, women’s apparently greater weighting of emotion and empathy implies a correspondingly <em>reduced</em> weighting of more abstract and emotionally neutral mental operations. It’s easy to imagine that throughout human history women in effect have been engaged in a “mental arms-race” with men, evolving their own distinctively female set of cognitive and persuasive weaponry. That we still tend to hold up the chief “male” weapon, reason, as the highest mental faculty, may be <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/why-do-humans-reason-arguments-for-an-argumentative-theory/53E3F3180014E80E8BE9FB7A2DD44049">due</a> in large part merely to men’s historical hegemony in intellectual matters—so that, as that hegemony slips, the special status of reason can be expected to <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/why-do-humans-reason-arguments-for-an-argumentative-theory/53E3F3180014E80E8BE9FB7A2DD44049">slip too</a>.</p>
<p>The late 20th and early 21st centuries also have been marked by tremendous social contagions, from epidemics of arguably fake diseases (e.g., multiple personality disorder) to routine media-driven outbreaks of “outrage,” particularly of the politically correct variety—commonly compared to the witch-hunts of old. Is the cultural ascendancy of women to blame for this trend too?</p>
<p>Perhaps it is. If empathy is the ability to feel what others are feeling, then a more empathetic person is mentally more connected—more <em>acutely</em> and <em>immediately</em> connected—to others and in general to her social surroundings. Though much of it is <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health/2012/02/03/mass-hysteria-rare-but-usually-seen-in-girls/">anecdotal</a> (not nearly enough experimental work has been done in this area) there is some evidence that women do tend to have greater “connectedness” in this sense. For example: Women and girls, versus men and boys, are more likely (about twice as likely) to be diagnosed with PTSD after <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1186%2F2042-6410-3-29">trauma</a>. They tend to be more interested in social <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/Media-Mentions/2009/Women-Outnumber-Men-on-Social-Networking-Sites.aspx">networking</a>. They are more hypnotizable and suggestible (and become moreso when <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19678556">pregnant</a>). They are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2096969">more likely</a> to confabulate false memories and participate in mass <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3067396">psychosomatic incidents</a> of the kind that, for example, spuriously sicken anxious <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24138153">schoolchildren</a> every year.</p>
<p>Women moreover have been the initiators and principal transmitters of the most notorious hysterical contagions in history. These include the original witch-hunts—the convent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Gaufridi">demon-possessions</a> of early 17<sup>th</sup> century France, for example, and the later, much more lethal bewitchment-accusation craze in Puritan New England—as well as the hysterical neurosis syndromes that so captivated Charcot and Freud, and the related recovered-memory epidemics of recent decades. (Although historically in the West these have seemed to be isolated outbreaks, there is a substantial anthropological <a href="http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3316878?uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103863373051">literature</a> suggesting that women in premodern, patriarchal societies routinely—and competitively and contagiously—use “spirit possession” and similar tactics for mundane ends.)</p>
<p>Note that these female-driven contagions, across wide stretches of history and culture and including our modern outbreaks, have all in some way been about claiming the status of victim, for oneself or for someone else. I don’t know that “playing the victim” is a latent reflex in the female psyche, but it would make sense in terms of evolutionary psychology if the physically weaker sex, over tens of millenia of social evolution, had developed a reliance on such passive strategies. If it did, then women’s new cultural ascendancy would virtually guarantee that victimization stories become as prominent in media and influential on policymaking as they are.</p>
<p>Does all this strike you as unacceptably inflammatory and insulting speculation? If so, you’re in good company. Already many areas of scientific research (e.g., cognitive differences between men and women, or among ethnic groups) are <a href="https://www.dana.org/Cerebrum/2014/Equal_%E2%89%A0_The_Same__Sex_Differences_in_the_Human_Brain/">effectively off limits</a>, and the idea of <a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/2013/05/16/should-research-on-race-and-iq-be-banned/">overtly banning</a> certain types of inquiry is now almost mainstream. Interestingly, this trend has been pioneered by some of the institutions that should best symbolize the free-inquiry ideal.</p>
<p>Consider what happened at Harvard in 2005—a classic case of clashing mindsets. The Harvard President at the time, Lawrence Summers (later of the Obama Administration), was under pressure to increase female enrollment in technical degree programs. One day Summers gave a talk that touched on this delicate subject. He suggested, based on published data, that men as compared to women don’t necessarily have more aptitude on average for technical subjects—but they do have <i>a wider distribution</i> of aptitude, i.e., longer tails on their Bell curves, so that they are marginally more likely to be geniuses <i>or dullards</i>. The slight surfeit of male high-achievers, he went on, might help explain why men still dominate the very limited number of “tenured positions in science and engineering at top universities and research institutions.”</p>
<p>As tame and defensible as such a suggestion might seem, Summers’s willingness to contemplate any sort of gender-based difference in aptitude was enough to trigger outrage, and a long and painful inquisition. The psychologist <a href="http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/2005_01_19_crimson.html">Steven Pinker</a> and a few others strongly backed Summers, and Summers himself made several abject public <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=abdPmeSJADQ8">apologies</a> (“…I was wrong to have spoken in a way that has resulted in an unintended signal of discouragement to talented girls and women…”) but the Harvard faculty soon passed a motion of “lack of confidence” in his leadership. Summers resigned the following year.</p>
<p>In this episode the loudest cries of condemnation came from female academics, and the weird part of all this is how unselfconsciously some of them displayed a clichéd femininity—as if, in our brave, new, pink-tinted world, they had no further need to conceal their cognitive differentness, notwithstanding the issue at hand! Amid the uproar, for example, one woman professor dramatically <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/18/national/18harvard.html">told </a>a <i>New York Times</i> reporter: “When he started talking about innate differences in aptitude between men and women, <i>I just couldn’t breathe because this kind of bias makes me physically ill.</i>” [italics mine]</p>
<p><b>Here’s to the new boss</b></p>
<p>What I’ve written above will seem biased against women. But I could have constructed an argument about the negative features of Western societies before the recent ascendancy of women: much more violence and acceptance of violence, for example, and more susceptibility to complex, inhumane ideologies—given the dominance of a testosterone-driven, lower-empathy, compulsively system-building (i.e., male) brain.</p>
<p>Anyway this essay isn’t really about the rightness or wrongness of the social changes that have occurred in America. It is about the likely origins of those changes. Admittedly, though, if those changes arose mostly from a simple demographic shift, then that would tend to undermine the claim that they represent an inevitable Progress. Moreover, one might wonder whether, in the long run, a mindset that evolved not for the “understanding and building of systems” (Baron-Cohen’s words) but for tasks such as child-rearing can succeed in the management of complex modern societies and states. Conceivably it <em>will</em> succeed; conceivably it will turn out to be <em>better</em> suited (than the traditional male mindset) for a modern, relatively peaceful world. But just as conceivably, or maybe a lot more conceivably, empathy-driven feelgood policies in the long run will lead, even in countries that had been rich and stable, to fiscal and social collapses—creating opportunities that less feminized cultures will want to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Submission-Novel-Michel-Houellebecq/dp/1250097347/">exploit</a>.</p>

<p>Even if such a cataclysm never comes, the fact is that something fundamental has changed in the inner workings of the modern world. The structures of societies are already adjusting and realigning in response. But, curiously, the nature of the change is such that no one seems to want to talk about it or even acknowledge it.</p>

<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><em>Originally published 27 December 2011</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few weeks ago Jeremy Clarkson, a well-known British TV personality, was asked on a BBC talk show what he thought of an ongoing strike by UK public-sector workers. He <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/8927036/Jeremy-Clarkson-execute-public-sector-workers-says-BBC-Top-Gear-host.html">replied</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I’d have them all shot. I’d take them outside and execute them in front of their families. How dare they go on strike when they’ve got these gilt-edged pensions that are going to be guaranteed, while the rest of us have to work for a living …</p>
<p>Now, it was the sort of exaggerated remark that wouldn’t have seemed out of place at a pub or a even at a cocktail party. People would have understood it as an example of rhetorical excess&#8212;particularly coming from Clarkson, who indulges in it fairly <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2011/12/01/jeremy-clarkson-strike-gaffe-the-top-gear-presenter-s-top-10-most-outspoken-moments-115875-23602085/">often</a>. Somehow, though, Clarkson-style rhetorical excess is considered threatening to the fragile minds of UK TV viewers, and so this episode triggered the familiar expressions of outrage, demands for his firing, etc.&#8212;from the usual offense-takers and outrageists, who by now comprise a sort of immune response against any flareup of un-PC talk in the media. (Both the BBC and Clarkson had to apologize.)</p>
<p>The PC/un-PC battle of the past two decades is winding down, in favor of the former; and besides, it’s old news. But there is an aspect to this struggle that seems worth highlighting, because to my knowledge no one has picked up on it.</p>
<p>To begin with, the phrase “take them outside and execute them in front of their families”&#8212;like the classic “bomb them back to the Stone Age” (attributed to USAF General Curtis LeMay) – represents a distinct strain of un-PC talk. It offends not because it takes an archaic view of some minority group, but because it takes an archaic view of violence and punishment.</p>
<p>Note, however, that “take them outside and execute them in front of their families” is not just an impulsive, brutish expression of anger. It contains a far-sighted strategy: not simply to punish miscreants but also to make a public example of them, so that others will be discouraged from behaving in the same way. In this sense, it is rational and utilitarian, and aims to minimize net punitive force and pain in the long term.</p>
<p>What it lacks, of course, is empathy for those who would suffer in the near-term from such a course of action. The psychologist Simon Baron-Cohen has been arguing, for some years now and with evidence from his and other studies, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Essential-Difference-Female-Brains-Autism/">that</a> too little empathy is a sign of too much “maleness,” cognitively speaking:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The female brain is predominantly hard-wired for empathy. The male brain is predominantly hard-wired for understanding and building systems.</p>
<p>Baron-Cohen proposes that the autistic or Asperger’s brain is for the most part a hyper-male brain, with too much systematizing ability&#8212;though a high amount would be good for many modern high-tech jobs&#8212;and too little empathy. Even on ordinary personality tests, answering a utilitarian “yes” to a question such as “if you could save ten people by killing one in cold blood, would you do it?” is nowadays thought to indicate a disturbing lack of empathy. Answering “yes” to too many such questions can lead to a diagnosis of sociopathy, and these sociopathy tests are even used to <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/05/26/136619689/can-a-test-really-tell-whos-a-psychopath">determine</a> whether or not criminals should be paroled.</p>
<p>Clearly, though, our views about what constitutes an acceptable level of empathy have changed greatly in recent centuries&#8212;even in recent decades. For example, we and other Western countries used to make quite free use of capital punishment, and in public spaces. Now capital punishment occurs only behind prison walls, and is much less common. Our wars too are far less bloody now, and though we care primarily about our own casualties, we also are far more sensitive to the harm caused to non-combatants than we used to be (think of LeMay’s deliberate fire-bombing of Tokyo civilians in 1944-45&#8212;and of course, Hiroshima and Nagasaki).</p>
<p>Un-PC speech&#8212;or speech that would now get that label&#8212;used to be common as well. We cringe at some of the things that men said (or did) to women or minorities in old Hollywood movies, or that politicians of even a few generations ago uttered in speeches while no one minded.</p>
<p>There has also been a feminization and de-martialization of public grieving following atrocities, e.g., the terrorist kind: the angry, vengeful speeches of yesteryear have been replaced by flowers, candles and &#8220;forgiveness.&#8221;</p>
<p>It has been clear for a while now that these empathy-related changes in public discourse are due in large part to the recent, unprecedented entry of women into public life in Western countries. Women have not only the right to vote but also a presence in key areas of society&#8212;science, law, business, politics&#8212;as never before, and it would be hard to believe that their influence has not changed the culture, bending it towards their own cognitive style. People now use the jokey phrase “endangered white male” to refer to guys like Jeremy Clarkson, but what may be truly endangered here is the male cognitive style.</p>
<p>That may not be a good thing, if the male cognitive style evolved to be optimal for managing societies, while the female cognitive style is tuned for the rearing of children. There is a tendency in our culture now to treat empathy as a trait to be simply maximized. But “understanding and building systems,” as Baron-Cohen puts it, is useful, too&#8212;and perhaps most if not all of our culture’s greatest failings now come not from a lack of empathy but from a failure to see how complex systems fit together, and how they may fly apart.</p>
<p>What also worries me is that too much empathy, or other related aspects of the female cognitive style, may be&#8212;we don’t know; probably no scientist would go near this question&#8212;less compatible with the reasoned debate and calm analytical thinking that are presumably needed in a healthy democracy, or in any mature society. Several years ago, then-Harvard President Lawrence Summers (who was later a White House adviser) referred rather delicately to the <em>possibility </em>that male/female cognitive differences <em>partly </em>explain the relative lack of female professors in math and science; he was, in effect, shouted down and forced from his post. A vocal minority on the faculty (representing the female cognitive style one might say) deemed Summers&#8217;s suggestion too offensive, the man himself too insensitive. Apparently it did not occur to them that they were helping to illustrate his point. (One female professor earnestly <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/18/national/18harvard.html">told </a>a reporter: &#8220;When he started talking about innate differences in aptitude between men and women, I just couldn&#8217;t breathe because this kind of bias makes me physically ill.&#8221;)</p>
<p>An inflexible, authoritarian, shout-them-down tendency is often said to be a feature of PC-think generally. PC-driven marches and protests (on campuses for example ) typically are meant not to broaden a discourse but, rather, to repel or suppress an unwanted speaker&#8212;much as a mother, without any pretense of democracy or debate, would try to protect her children from an unwanted influence or their own innate waywardness. (&#8220;Because I said so!&#8221;)</p>
<p>Americans on the whole appear to be getting more like this: more extreme and emotion-driven in their politics and public discourse, and less open to opposing views. Could the rising influence of the &#8220;fairer,&#8221; more nurturing, less violent sex be a major reason?</p>
